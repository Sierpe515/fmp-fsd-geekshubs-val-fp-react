## About this project

![6457f1f9ca13e314516213](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121863208/236696836-64bc29d7-7084-4b61-aa76-89f5d3f2c2c2.gif)


<p align="center">
We are before the frontend of my final Project for the GeekHubs Academy’s Full Stack bootcamp. This project, realized with React, connects to the API which manage the business functionality. 
Given that this time we had full autonomy to choose the kind of project we wanted, meeting the minimum requirements, I developed a game, a graphic adventure for browser which will test the philosophical and mathematical logic knowledge of the player.  
Among other things, the user will be able to register and log in the application and, once inside, will be able to create characters with which to play as many games as they want. 
The administrator also has the faculties to enter in the administration area and being able to see a list of every user and manage various sections as of them as of their saved games. 
However, the bulk of the functionalities of this app is found in the game itself and its mechanics, which I expect make of it an interesting and entertaining game with which improve the logical abilities of the user.

## Local installation

There are various forms of launching this application. The first and easiest is accessing directly to the following link, as the web is already deployed in AWS:

[App link](https://master.dd0sj1hk51bnt.amplifyapp.com)

The second one is going to the GitHub's directory and download its content. Given that it is a job integrated by backend and frontend, it is necessary to download as well the database, which is located in this direction: 

[Database GitHub](https://github.com/Sierpe515/fmp-fsd-geekshubs-val-laravel-proof) 

And follow the next steps:

Steps to make it work on your local computer:
1. Clone the project on your computer with git bash:
 `$git clone 'url-repository'`
2. Install all dependencies with the following command:
 ` $ compose install `
3. Create a .env file following the template .env.example provided and type all credentials. If you cannot get them, change the parameters for your own local database set up running in docker.
4.  Start the server with:
 ``` $ php artisan serve ```
5. Connect the repository with the database with the following commands:
 ``` $ php artisan migrate ``` 
 ``` $ php artisan db:seed ``` 

The database is ready to operate autonomously once is running thanks to the seeders contained in it, which grant a base to realize the proper actions.  
Once the database is running, we have to do the same with the frontend. That is to say, download the content of this repository and install dependencies. It can be made following this steps: 

Steps to make it work on your local computer:
1. Clone the project on your computer with git bash:
 `$git clone 'url-repository'`
2. Install all dependencies with the following command:
 ` $ npm i `
3.  Start the server with:
 ``` $ npm run dev ```
 

## How do we do it

In order to develop this application, the technologies mention in the part 2, Stack, have been used. But the main and fundamental technologies to keep it up and running are React y Redux. 
In this occasion, we found ourselves before a complete web application. It can be interacting with and also our actions will have effect in the database, whether it is to extract data o send it. 
We are before the most ambitious project we have faced, not only for its complexity, but also for the quantity of hours invested in it. When trying to provide the web with almost every functionality I wish I could include, it is made up of numerous layouts or pages and every single one has a functionality, for show information brought from the backend or request another with real time callings, with the possibility of interfering sending new information, modifying or erasing it. 
Thanks to Redux, the web components have the capability to communicate between themselves, sending information or picking it up from any part of the application, which facilitates working with it without excessive communication with the backend.  
To be able to get the obtained result, the backend has been modified in numerous occasions, in order to be able to grant it various functionalities which were not initially foreseen but were necessary or relevant with the frontend inclusion. For example, with the inclusion of more endpoints or the modifying of models and migrations. 
It is worth mentioning that the use of some React functions like hooks or useEffect which application is fundamental to the functioning of the whole page architecture.
In this occasion, what we wanted to develop was a complete game, what has meant an additional difficulty at the time of develop every aspect of the application. Not only we have had to develop a complete product which allows the user to execute certain functionalities, but also, we have had to create a game’s mechanic and design the game’s levels with the objective that the game turns out playable and fun. 
These are some images which show some steps of the development of the application:

## Project structure
This project's structure starts in an index.html file which links with the other files. First of all, a file main.jsx which through a react-dom and react-router-dom connects with the rest of files.  After that, in MainApp.jsx, we declare the skeleton that every layout will have, and through the file Body.jsx we declare and link every route of our project. These routes belong to the layouts, which is a folder that can be found in the repository src. 
In the folder app, we found the file store.js which is the principal file of Redux that make it start running, connecting with slice files. 
At the same time, we have the components folder, where we store every reusable item that we are going to bring from various layouts or even from everyone. 
At last, the services folder, in which we store the file in charge of communicate with the backend through axios, and helpers, in which the validations file can be found. 



## Design

In this occasion, I developed a game. For this reason, an interface has had to be designed to help the user immerse in it. Because of that, despite the fact it is a web application, I tried to make it as a conventional game as possible. 
The main topic of the game is the world of deep dreams. This has given me a great deal of freedom to design the game levels, given that I was not limited to a one theme which gave coherence to the product, I was able to develop levels with any theme. 
Can be said, that every menu and elements have been created with the intention to be intuitive for the user and of easy access to be simple moving through the different pages which make the application. 
Even though both images and fonts have been used to give the application that unique videogame atmosphere, every effort has been made to ensure that these elements do not hinder user accessibility.


## The Game

It is a game created exclusively for this occasion, graphic adventure type but very different in a certain way. This is a game that, in addition to telling a story, has the objective of testing the level of comprehension of the player's mathematical or philosophical logic, while it can improve it by overcoming certain challenges. 
The objective of the game is to overcome a series of stages before reaching the final stage, which will be a real challenge for any logic’s fan.
It should be said that all the problems raised in the game and that the player must overcome, always have a single possible solution that can be deduced with the information shown to the user in each stage. 
It should be said that this game has been developed, as mentioned before, mainly using React technology, which, in any case, is not intended for game development. But given the characteristics of the game, which is similar to the behavior of web pages, the result has been, in our opinion, quite optimal and satisfactory. 

## How it is played

Like any game worth its salt, Oniria has its own rules and mechanics that the user must understand and follow if they want to reach the end.
Using the application is very simple, since it works like any web page. Once the user has created a character and selected a game, they can start a game in which all they have to do is read the text that shows the logical problem posed for the stage they are in, and, once they think they know the answer, choose between one of the options that will be displayed in buttons, below the text.
The important thing to be able to progress properly in the game is to know that, with each mistake made by the player, a madness point will be accumulated, which will be displayed on the screen. Depending on the level selected for the game, the madness that the character can withstand will be higher or lower.
It is no less important to know that with certain successes, the player will be able to win achievements (badges), which can be exchanged for clues that will help to solve the problem of the stage in which he is. Achievements, once used, will be consumed, and disappear from the player's view. 
Finally, after choosing a right answer, the player will be able to access the explanation of the problem whose solution has been correct, so that they can understand (if they wish) the reasons that should have led them to select said answer. Therefore, an explanation of the logical reasoning that the player must have carried out before responding will be shown on the screen. 

## Atmosphere 

Oniria is a realm of the world of deep sleep. Therefore, we are in a game set in dreams.
The idea arose in one of those endless nights in which it is almost impossible to fall asleep. In this way, and with this theme in mind, I began to consider that the idea of setting the game in a dream world gave me a lot of freedom when it came to introducing a wide variety of themes.
The first thing we find when we enter the game is a strong visual component, generated thanks to the images that we have borrowed from Artstation (link) and whose artists and studios we thank. I would like to give a special mention to Edouard Guiton (link), who has provided us with the images for most of the pnjs in the game.
Attempts have been made to give the game a fuzzy dreamlike atmosphere. Almost a nebula of confusion. Because you already know how dreams are, diffuse and unpredictable.
For all these reasons, the game draws a certain influence from the most classic graphic adventures, such as Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Broken Sword and many more. But also games of another genre and completely different settings, such as Diablo, to also achieve a certain darkness and danger in certain stages.
Thanks to this great diversity, we can find stages set in reptilian cities, other oriental ones with Onis, dungeons, etc. And also a rich variety of characters, whether they are vampires, humanoid turtles or cats, infernal beings, and a long etc. 


## Known bugs

During this project's development I found several errors, of which, one I was not able to resolve before the delivery date. 
- In the user profile area, updating the last name field causes the first name input to be displayed. 


## Future functionalities

If I could devote more time to this project in the future, I would love to implement pagination, both to the backend and frontend. 
Another functionality that I did not introduce due to lack of time, is the translation of the game into English. But I would like to do it in the near future.

I would also have liked to implement a statistics section, since the database is designed to extract all possible information in this regard. So a section would be introduced in the administration area in which to see what percentage of players go through certain stages of the game and within that stage, what percentage of players have selected each answer. 

These elements could help us gauge the level of difficulty in future expansions and even make modifications to existing ones.
I would also like to implement a new functionality to the badges, which is to show the user with the use of this, the percentage of selections that each response of the stage they are in has had to date, which can help them to decide. 

Of course, in the future I would like to develop different games apart from Oniria, that follow the same dynamics, to expand the variety and depth of the application.
Two of those already appear, although not as selectable, they are Portia's chests, which would be a very similar game, and tic tac toe, which is quite different.
